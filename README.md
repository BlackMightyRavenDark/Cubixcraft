# Cubixcraft
Just another useless Minecraft parody

Cubixcraft Java launcher uses my own local web server to retrieve game versions. It's will does not work when my computer or router is down.
At a current stage of coding the Cubixcraft is a little boring flat world. I will try to make it better, i promise.
Because of version tagging problems, i am not able to upload the Java Launcher binary directly to the GitHub. So, you must download the Launcher from my web server:
http://46.175.35.158/files/cubixcraft/java/cubixcraft_launcher.jar
or
http://46.175.39.161/files/cubixcraft/java/cubixcraft_launcher.jar
I hope it will works fine. You also needs the Java 8 JRE.
