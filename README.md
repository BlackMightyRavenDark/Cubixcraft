# Cubixcraft
Just another useless Minecraft parody

Cubixcraft Java launcher uses my own local web server to retrieve game versions. It's will does not work when my computer or router is down.
At a current stage of coding the Cubixcraft is a little boring flat world. I will try to make it better, i promise.
